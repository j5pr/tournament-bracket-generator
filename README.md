# Tournament Bracket Management Application

## Project Proposal

I would like to design a tournament bracket management application. 
The application would allow a user to design and visualize a tournament bracket
of various types, input the teams to participate in the tournament, and generate
a visual view of the generated bracket. 
Using this generated view, the user would be able to input the results of each
game in the tournament, and input the results of each game. When all games
are complete, the filled-in bracket would be available for the user to view.

This application would be useful for people running tournaments, as it would
provide an interface and visualization for planning tournaments.
I am interested in this project because I have experience running game tournaments,
and would find benefit from such an application. I also find interest in
different ways of visualizing data, which would be a core part of this application.
